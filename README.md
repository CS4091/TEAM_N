# Air-to-Ground Search Project

## Overview
The **Air-to-Ground Search Project** will implement and compare several path planning algorithms to determine the most efficient flight paths for aircraft operating in a 2D grid world. The algorithms aim to maximize grid coverage while minimizing movements, adhering to constraints such as fixed movement patterns (forward, left, right) and navigating around static obstacles.
